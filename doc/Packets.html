        <h3>Incoming packets</h3>
        Incoming packets are a PyObject with a PyTuple containing 9 elements.<br>
        The first element is an int containing the packet type defined in the MACHONETMSG_TYPE enum.<br>
        The second element is an object containing the source address (PyAddress).<br>
        The third element is the destination address (PyAddress).<br>
        The fourth element is the userID.<br>
        The fifth element is the payload as a PyTuple.<br>
        The sixth element is a dictionary of named elements (PyDict).<br>
        The last three elements are PyNone.<br>
        <h3>Call Requests</h3>
        The payload is a single element PyTuple containing a PyTuple that contains 2 elements.<br>
        The first value is a PyInt that is currently an unknown and unused value.<br>
        The second value is a PyTuple that contains 4 elements decoded as a PyCallStream.<br>
        The first element is eight an int of string, and is decoded into either remoteObject or remoteObjectStr values.<br>
        The second element is the method name.<br>
        The third element is the argument list decoded into arg_tuple.<br>
        The fourth element is PyDict containing key value pairs decoded into arg_dict.<br>
        <h3>Calling a service</h3>
        When a PyService is called the PyService->Call function is passed the method name, arg_tuple and arg_dict values from the PyCallStream.<br>
        A method MachoResolveObject return the nodeID (PyInt).<br>
        A method MachoBindObject the arg_tuple is a 2 element tuple decoded into CallMachoBindObject.  The first tuple is the bindParams the second is an optional call parameters as a callName, arguments and argument dictionary.<br>
